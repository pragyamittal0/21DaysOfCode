#### Day - 37
###### Power(x,n)

1. You are given a number x.
2. You are given another number n.
3. You are required to calculate x raised to the power n. Don't change the signature of power function .

Note -> The online judge can't force you to write the function recursively but that is what the spirit of question is. Write recursive and not iterative logic.
The purpose of the question is to aid learning recursion and not test you.

###### zigzag
1. Here are a few sets of inputs and outputs for your reference
Input1 -> 1
Output1 -> 1 1 1

Input2 -> 2
Output2 -> 2 1 1 1 2 1 1 1 2

Input2 -> 3
Output3 -> 3 2 1 1 1 2 1 1 1 2 3 2 1 1 1 2 1 1 1 2 3

2. Figure out the pattern and complete the recursive function pzz to achieve the above for any positive number n.
