### Day3
##### Rotate a number
1. You are given two numbers n and k. You are required to rotate n, k times to the right. If k is positive, rotate to the right i.e. remove rightmost digit and make it leftmost. Do the reverse for negative value of k. Also k can have an absolute value larger than number of digits in n.
2. Take as input n and k.
3. Print the rotated number.
4. Note - Assume that the number of rotations will not cause leading 0's in the result. e.g. such an input will not be given
   n = 12340056
   k = 3
   r = 05612340
##### GDC and LCM
1. You are required to print the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of two numbers.
2. You are also required to print the Lowest Common Multiple (LCM) of the same numbers.
3. Take input "num1" and "num2" as the two numbers.
4. Print their GCD and LCM.
