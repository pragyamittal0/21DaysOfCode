### Day3
##### Rotate a number
1. You are given two numbers n and k. You are required to rotate n, k times to the right. If k is positive, rotate to the right i.e. remove rightmost digit and make it leftmost. Do the reverse for negative value of k. Also k can have an absolute value larger than number of digits in n.
2. Take as input n and k.
3. Print the rotated number.
4. Note - Assume that the number of rotations will not cause leading 0's in the result. e.g. such an input will not be given
   n = 12340056
   k = 3
   r = 05612340
##### GDC and LCM
1. You are required to print the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of two numbers.
2. You are also required to print the Lowest Common Multiple (LCM) of the same numbers.
3. Take input "num1" and "num2" as the two numbers.
4. Print their GCD and LCM.
##### Prime Factorization
1. You are required to display the prime factorization of a number.
2. Take as input a number n.
3. Print all its prime factors from smallest to largest
##### Benjamin Bulbs
1. You are given n number of bulbs. They are all switched off. A weird fluctuation in voltage hits the circuit n times. In the 1st fluctuation all bulbs are toggled, in the 2nd fluctuation every 2nd bulb is toggled, in the 3rd fluctuation every 3rd bulb is toggled and so on. You've to find which bulbs will be switched on after n fluctuations.
2. Take as input a number n, representing the number of bulbs.
3. Print all the bulbs that will be on after the nth fluctuation in voltage.
